#### First Look at the Project

From the initial read, I just need to make a command-line tool that manages the 
index file given read as a B-tree. The index file has a very specific layout I'll have
to follow. The program has create, insert, search, load, print, and extract commands. I 
also need to make sure that only 3 nodes are stored in memory at once.

I hope to finish this in one sitting !

#### Notes for planning etc.
Probably just going to do this all in 1 file for simplicity.
Had to do a similar assignment for Dr. Khan's advanced algorithms class, gonna
see if I can find that file, but that project was single values only.
